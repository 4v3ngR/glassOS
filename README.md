# glassOS
A collection of themes and styles for KDE for a glassOS look

## Better blur
This collection can work with any of the better blur forks. The switcher only edits brightness, contrast, and saturation when switching between dark and light modes.

## Darkly
This collection can work with any colorscheme that provides transparency. For best results, using the Darkly application style is recommended.
