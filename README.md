# glassOS
A collection of themes and styles for KDE for a glassOS look

## Better blur
This collection can work with any of the better blur forks. The switcher only edits brightness, contrast, and saturation when switching between dark and light modes.

## Darkly
This collection can work with any colorscheme that provides transparency. For best results, using the Darkly application style is recommended.

## The switcher script
The switcher script (switcher/theme) now has four options:
- dark
- light
- dark-glass
- light-glass

The script updates:
- global theme
- plasma theme
- better blur settings (brightness, contrast, saturation, blur level)
- default konsole profile (dark or light)
